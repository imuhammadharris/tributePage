    <h1 class="main">Hail the Unbelievables! How Pakistan found cricketing redemption</h1>
    <h2 class="sub animated fadeIn">The Pakistan Cricket Team</h2>
  <p class="text animated fadeInUp">For a story to successfully attach itself to a sports team over a number of decades while players and personnel change, while the game itself changes, while the world changes, it has to be flexible as well as meaningful and distinct. In the case of cricket, no team has a more oft-invoked story than the Pakistan national side. In the three decades I’ve been pinning my emotional wellbeing to the fortunes of the Pakistan cricket team, they have always been a group of men about whom you say: “They can win this, but it’s quite likely they won’t,” and equally: “They can’t win this, but it’s possible they will.” The Unpredictables. The Mercurials. The Never-Count-Them-Outs. But although this story has been shaping itself since the 80s, it became cast in stone 25 years ago, when Imran Khan’s team started their World Cup campaign in the most startlingly dismal manner, relying on a win against cricket-minnows Zimbabwe and a rain-enforced draw with England to get them past the initial stages of the tournament, and then went on to win five matches in a row and lift the cup.</p>
   <p class="text animated fadeInUp">I was there, at the Oval. I was there not because I had thought to buy a ticket – like so many Pakistani supporters, I had lost faith in the story and was sure Pakistan wouldn’t be playing. But an English friend had a pair of tickets and his team wasn’t in the final, so he gave them to my sister and me. I went in with that glimmer of hope, but also much trepidation – not only about the game but about the crowd. The stakes were so high, the sun so strong, the political baggage so heavy. Surely, it would take only the tiniest thing to make tempers fray. But then the two teams walked out side by side, no hostility in their body language and even some smiles between them. Everyone stood up and applauded. The Indian national anthem played. The Pakistani supporters remained standing. The Pakistani national anthem played. The Indian supporters remained standing. And right then I knew the crowd would be fine. It would be a replay of Karachi 2004, when the Indian side started its first full tour of Pakistan since 1990, and the only mood in the stands was of friendliness and good humour. But when Pakistan ended their innings with 338 runs, I also remembered that, in that Karachi match, India had scored 344 to win an incredibly close match. So, when the India innings started and Amir took a wicket with the third delivery, it was hard not to have the jubilation mixed with the terror of knowing that the brilliant Indian captain, Virat Kohli, was going to walk out to the middle. In Amir’s next over, when Azhar Ali dropped a straightforward catch to give the captain another life, I thought, here we are, this is it, bad old Pakistan back again. But then the unthinkable happened – with the very next delivery, Kohli edged the ball to the new boy Shadab Khan, who held on to it, and the captain was gone. India were 6-2. Despite the heroics of Hardik Pandya with the bat, India never looked likely to win it from that point on, although I can only say this in retrospect. While the match was still on, I kept remembering hope’s propensity, in the life of a Pakistan cricket fan, for making sudden exits just when you think it has come to stay. But hope wasn’t teasing this time. Pakistan won by 180 runs.</p>
   <p class="text animated fadeInUp">When the match ended, Kohli was both generous and gracious in defeat, which added to the feeling that we were in a parallel universe – one in which the sun shone on English fields, Pakistan played brilliantly, Indian and Pakistani supporters joked around with each other, and Kohli won Pakistani hearts. It would be nice to take things even further. It would be nice to say that cricket can transform Indo-Pak relations. It can’t do that. But at its best, it can afford a place of respite from the hostility; it can bring us into stands together bantering in Urdu, Hindi, Punjabi, English; it can make us want to see our teams play together more often, and not for the ugly reasons of wanting to crush the other, but for the joy of the sport that we love so passionately on both sides of the border.</p>
  <p class="text animated fadeInUp">When the trophy was lifted, the ceremony over, the Pakistan team made a lap of honour around the Oval pitch. They were laughing and smiling, raising the trophy in the direction of their supporters, running on legs that seemed fresh despite the hours playing in temperatures that were the same that day in London as in Karachi. All but one of them. As the team ran past the area in which I was standing I noticed a man walking slowly behind. It was the captain, Sarfraz Ahmed. Pakistan’s bowling coach, the former international player Azhar Mahmood, was walking alongside and had an arm around the younger man’s shoulder, talking to him. Sarfraz nodded once or twice but didn’t say anything. He ran a hand over his face, his expression one of disbelief. Then he looked ahead and saw how far he had become separated from his boys, and scampered to catch up with them. Forget the Mercurials and the Unpredictables. At the Oval on Sunday, his team were the Unbelievables.</p>
